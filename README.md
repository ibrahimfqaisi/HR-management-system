and i creat Accounting page its contain :
Header for navigating to any other pages and Footer have  copyright.

 i did refactor the render prototype function to render each employee information in a separate card in the home page

 Save all the employees in the Local Storage so when I refresh the page I will not lose my old data.
 Render  department information in a table.
